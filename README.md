# Machine-learning-algorithm

Devices exist to collect a large amount of datas at a low cost. In this example, datas are collected with accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm and dumbell of 6 participants.
They are told to perform it correctly and incorrectly and this step contributes to the training set of our algorithm. This is known as a supervised learning algorithm. 
During various preliminary tests with the caret package, I found out that Random Forest Algorithm provides a good performance
